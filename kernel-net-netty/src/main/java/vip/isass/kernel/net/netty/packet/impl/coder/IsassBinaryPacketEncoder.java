 *                     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *                         Version 3, 29 June 2007
 *
 *   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 *   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 *   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 *
 *
 *    This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
 *  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
 *  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
 *
 *    0. Additional Definitions.
 *
 *    As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
 *  General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
 *  General Public License.
 *
 *    "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
 *  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
 *
 *    An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
 *  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
 *  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
 *  of using an interface provided by the Library.
 *
 *    A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
 *  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
 *  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
 *  Version".
 *
 *    The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
 *  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
 *  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
 *  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
 *
 *    The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
 *  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
 *  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
 *  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
 *
 *    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 *
 *    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
 *  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 *
 *    2. Conveying Modified Versions.
 *
 *    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
 *  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
 *  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
 *  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
 *  version:
 *
 *     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
 *     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
 *     function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
 *     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
 *
 *     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
 *     this License applicable to that copy.
 *
 *    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
 *
 *    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
 *  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
 *  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
 *  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
 *  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
 *  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
 *
 *     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
 *     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
 *     covered by this License.
 *
 *     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
 *     document.
 *
 *    4. Combined Works.
 *
 *    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
 *  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
 *  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
 *  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
 *  the following:
 *
 *     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
 *     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
 *     covered by this License.
 *
 *     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
 *     document.
 *
 *     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
 *     execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
 *     these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
 *     copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
 *
 *     d) Do one of the following:
 *
 *         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
 *         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
 *         suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
 *         recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
 *         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
 *         manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
 *         Corresponding Source.
 *
 *         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 *         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
 *         a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
 *         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
 *         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
 *         Version.
 *
 *     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
 *     be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
 *     GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
 *     necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
 *     Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
 *     Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
 *     you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
 *     the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
 *     Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
 *     Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
 *     for conveying Corresponding Source.)
 *
 *    5. Combined Libraries.
 *
 *    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 *  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
 *  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
 *  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
 *  choice, if you do both of the following:
 *
 *     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
 *     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
 *     conveyed under the terms of this License.
 *
 *     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
 *     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
 *     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 *
 *    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 *
 *    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 *  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
 *  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 *  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 *
 *    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
 *  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
 *  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
 *  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 *  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
 *  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
 *  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
 *  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
 *  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 *    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
 *  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
 *  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
 *  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
 *  Library.
