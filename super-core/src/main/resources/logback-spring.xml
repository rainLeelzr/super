  ~                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  ~                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
  ~
  ~  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  ~  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  ~  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  ~
  ~
  ~   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
  ~ the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  ~ License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
  ~
  ~   0. Additional Definitions.
  ~
  ~   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  ~ General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  ~ General Public License.
  ~
  ~   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  ~ other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
  ~
  ~   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  ~ by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  ~ Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  ~ of using an interface provided by the Library.
  ~
  ~   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  ~ Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
  ~ with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  ~ Version".
  ~
  ~   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  ~ Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  ~ for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  ~ based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
  ~
  ~   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  ~ object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  ~ and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  ~ Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
  ~
  ~   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
  ~
  ~   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  ~ without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
  ~
  ~   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
  ~
  ~   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  ~ facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  ~ that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  ~ facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  ~ version:
  ~
  ~    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
  ~    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
  ~    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
  ~    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
  ~
  ~    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
  ~    this License applicable to that copy.
  ~
  ~   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
  ~
  ~   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  ~ a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
  ~ code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  ~ material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  ~ layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  ~ (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
  ~
  ~    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
  ~    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  ~    covered by this License.
  ~
  ~    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  ~    document.
  ~
  ~   4. Combined Works.
  ~
  ~   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  ~ taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  ~ portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  ~ engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  ~ the following:
  ~
  ~    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
  ~    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  ~    covered by this License.
  ~
  ~    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  ~    document.
  ~
  ~    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
  ~    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
  ~    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
  ~    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
  ~
  ~    d) Do one of the following:
  ~
  ~        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
  ~        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
  ~        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
  ~        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
  ~        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
  ~        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
  ~        Corresponding Source.
  ~
  ~        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  ~        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
  ~        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
  ~        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
  ~        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
  ~        Version.
  ~
  ~    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
  ~    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
  ~    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
  ~    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
  ~    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
  ~    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
  ~    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
  ~    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
  ~    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
  ~    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
  ~    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
  ~
  ~   5. Combined Libraries.
  ~
  ~   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  ~ Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  ~ facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  ~ License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  ~ choice, if you do both of the following:
  ~
  ~    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
  ~    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
  ~    conveyed under the terms of this License.
  ~
  ~    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
  ~    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
  ~    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  ~
  ~   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
  ~
  ~   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  ~ of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  ~ versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  ~ differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  ~
  ~   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  ~ Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  ~ of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  ~ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  ~ conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  ~ published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  ~ received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  ~ General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  ~ General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  ~
  ~   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  ~ whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  ~ apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  ~ permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  ~ Library.
